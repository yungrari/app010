The given project was presented during Winter School "Ethics of Neuroscience and AI" 2021. It was organized by Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Berlin, Berlin School of Mind and Brain and Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin. The aim of the Winter School was to study practical and ethical aspects in neuroscience, such as deep brain stimulation, brain death, data protection and neuromarketing. This year the focus was on artificial intelligence.

The web application was designed for Empirical Track "Brain Reading" E3 Group Work.

The main task of the group work was to evaluate the technical feasibility of consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for side-channel attacks.
